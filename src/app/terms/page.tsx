                discontinue the lifetime discount, provided that reasonable notice is given to affected

              </li>
              <li>May be modified or terminated if the subscriber violates these Terms of Service</li>
              <li>Does not apply to add-ons, additional features, or services not included in the base subscription</li>

              at its sole discretion.
